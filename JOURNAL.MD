5/28/25: Started designing the PCB, and picked parts!
I picked some basic parts, such as the specific MCU that I was going to use,
sensors that might be helpful for recording data, and a way to actually operate the thruster.

5/29/25: Fixed a couple of schematic issues, and added more parts!
After implementing some basic components yesterday, I decided to start implementing some of the
sensors, and finishing the basic components needed for the MCU to actually run!
I also looked at a ton of datasheets, I'll link some of the files tommorow!
